A.
One obstacle I faced was having to write out all the months and code conversions over and over again.  I know Python decently well, and if I was coding this in Python, I would have set up a list of months and dictionaries for the month to month code, century to century code, and day code to day of the week conversions.  I then would have used loops to index and check those.  However, I don't know how to do that C++ (yet!).  So, I had to do a lot more copy pasting, which of course has the danger of leading to typos and mistakes.

Another obstacle I faced was when I had multiple logic statements in one if statement.  After a brief Google, I found that if you want to use multiple logic statements in an if statement, you need to group each one by itself with parentheses.  If you want to group multiple logic statements together, you need to group those with an additional set of parentheses.  I had to do this with the leap year offset.  If year mod 4 = 0 AND year mod 100 != 0, it's a leap year.  However, there's an exception that if year mod 400 = 0, it's a leap year.  So here, I had to group each individual logic statement:
(year % 4 == 0)
(year % 100 != 0)
(year % 400 == 0)
Then, I had to group the first 2 with an AND and surround them with parentheses because both must be true to have it be a leap year.
((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0))
To incorporate the exception, I added an OR outside the parentheses.  Then, I enclosed the whole thing in parentheses (which is a lot of parentheses).
(((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0)) || (year % 400 == 0))
What was super helpful is that clicking a parenthesis or curly bracket in Xcode highlights its counterpart.

The final obstacle I encountered was that I started a new project in Xcode, and deleted the code inside of main().  However, I didn't realize that main was asking for an input.  It compiled just fine on Xcode and on Codeboard.  However, g31 immediately caught that!
